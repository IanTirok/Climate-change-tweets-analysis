# Climate-change-tweets-analysis
As part of the requirements for the completion of our Moringa School Data Science Course, We have scraped data regarding climate change and its effects including natural disaster. We will analyze this data and attempt to classify and identify trends

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Global climate is projected to continue to change over this century and beyond. The magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades depends primarily on the amount of 
heat-trapping gases emitted globally, and how sensitive the Earthâ€™s climate is to those emissions.
Scientists say that even if we were to stop emitting greenhouse gasses completely, it is still expected that the average temperature will continue to rise.
The effects of climate change are More frequent and intense: droughts, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and warming oceans can directly harm animals,
destroy the places they live, and wreak havoc on people's livelihoods and communities. As climate change worsens, dangerous weather events are becoming more frequent or severe.

The team and I then came to a consensus to try and find out some of the common trends in natural disasters and conversations on twitter.

We also seeked to identify trends over the time period 2015 - 2020, yearly , mothly and weekly

We came accross some very interesting facts.

Here's a snipet:

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

We did this analysis with the intention of identifying trends, causing factors and correlations within the tweets with the intention to inform public policy makers to make more informed decisions on police reforms


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Following our analysis we identified some gaps in the data and would like to continue improving the dashboard and analysis in order to come up with a better scope of what is happening in the Africa.
Some of the data that would have been nice to have are

### On a side note

Similar datasets for climate  change across the world would be interesting to work on
